# üåê Web3 Social Media DApp

> A decentralized, autonomous social media platform built with Web3, PostgreSQL, and React.

## üìñ Introduction

This project is a Web3-based social media application that integrates blockchain features such as on-chain logging (tweets, follows, NFTs) and contract event listening. It is designed to be **decentralized**, **secure**, and **extensible**, aiming to provide a next-generation social networking experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend & Backend Decoupling**  
  React-based frontend and Express-based backend operate independently, both capable of blockchain interaction.

- **PostgreSQL**  
  A distributed database used for persistent storage, chosen to balance decentralization and performance.

- **Redis**  
  Caching layer that ensures low latency and enhances user experience.

- **Smart Contract Listener**  
  Listens to on-chain events (e.g., tweets, follows, NFT interactions) to maintain state consistency and ensure data immutability.

- **Modular Smart Contracts**  
  Includes contracts for:
  - `TweetLog`
  - `FollowLog`
  - `NFTInteractionLog`
